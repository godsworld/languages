00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,539
Let's sign up to our website
using a browser extension named "MetaMask"

2
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:39,492
Choose a password that you will use
to access MetaMask

3
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:44,843
Usually your browser will remember this
password for you

4
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:59,501
Here you can see a "seed phrase":
12 english words

5
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:04,545
Please, write them on a piece of paper
and don't show to anybody

6
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:09,423
It's your "password", in case you'll lose
your access to MetaMask

7
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:14,122
or you'll want to use the same
"public key" on your smarphone/tablet

8
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:20,445
Confirm some of the words
you've written down

9
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:50,724
At the top you can see the first and
the last chars of your "public key"

10
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,190
Go back to our website,
then click on "refresh page"

11
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:08,712
Connect the wallet to this page

12
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:19,391
In the field "Message" you can see this
website address and a random number

13
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,282
Click on "Sign"

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,632
This green text is equal to your MetaMask
"public key"

15
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:32,311
From now on you can log in
with MetaMask

16
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:35,882
and your progress (and some settings)
will be saved

17
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,050
That's all

18
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:43,304
Have fun! :-)
