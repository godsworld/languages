            Unfortunatelly, over the centuries, the christians divided themselves in three main streams ("confessions"): catholic, orthodox and protestant.<br><br>
            Becuase the Holy Bible and the dogmas of faith for the catholics and the orthodox are very similar, in this project there are only two versions of the website available: catholic or protestant.<br><br>
            The biggest difference stays in the version of the Holy Bible that is being used. Even if the essence of the Holy Scriptures is the same, the catholic version of the Holy Bible counts 73 books and in the protestant version of the Holy Bible there are 66 books that are considered inspired by God.<br><br>
            Anyway one must keep in mind that all the christian confessions has in common:<br><br>
            - the faith in Holy Bible as God's Word<br>
            - existance of one God but in three persons: Father, Son and the Holy Spirit<br>
            - the faith in Jesus Christ as God's Son: a true man and true God in one person<br><br>
