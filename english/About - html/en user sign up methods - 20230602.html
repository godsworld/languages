        <h2>USER SIGN UP METHODS</h2>
        <h3>SIGN UP WITH AN E-MAIL</h3>
        <div>
            Just insert your e-mail address, the password you want to use on this website, then click the "Confirm" button.<br>
            If everything is gone well, you'll see an information: "User not verified".<br>
            Go to your e-mail box, find the verification e-mail that was automatically sent to you and click on the confirmation link (if you can't find it, check the "spam" folder).<br>
        </div>
        <h3>SIGN UP WITH METAMASK (recommended)</h3>
        <div>
            MetaMask is a free extension that, in just a few minutes, you can install in your browser (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Safari, etc...).<br>
            Even if it's used mainly to manage cryptocurrencies, it's a great tool to sign up (and log in) into a webpage that allows this kind of authorization, in a simple and secure way.<br>
            When you're signing up to a website with your e-mail address, you can be anxious about: to whom I'm giving my address? Will they send me some unwanted e-mails (spam), or will they sell my data to someone else, or what if a hacker hacks their database, will my e-mail be compromised, too?<br>
            All these preocupations disappear when you sign up with MetaMask.<br>
            This extension create and manages for you two important strings, called "keys":<br>
            1) a public key (called also: public address)<br>
            2) a private key<br>
            The public key is a long string of chars (it looks like: 0xjlvjo23lkjvcoiu32...) that can be seen by anyone (you can compare it to your e-mail address).<br>
            The private key instead is also a long string of chars, but you should never show it to anyone (you can compare it to your e-mail password).<br>
            When somebody knows your public key, he can't do anything bad with it (can't send any kind of spam, for example) and it's practically impossible to hack, because the private key ("password") is a very long and complicated string.

        <h4>How to install MetaMask on computer</h4>
        <div>
            Before or after reading this article you probably would like to watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbkI0Q3BXmc">YouTube</a>.<br>
            There is more than one way to install MetaMask on computer, let's follow this one:<br>
            Open our page: <a href="https://www.god-s-world.net">www.god-s-world.net</a><br>
            Click on "Enter", then on "Sign up with MetaMask".<br>
            You'll be informed that MetaMask isn't present, and asked if you want to install it? Select "Yes".<br>
            The MetaMask official webpage will be opened and you'll see a button "Add to Chrome" (or other text if you use a different browser). Click on it, then "Add extension".<br>
            After MetaMask is installed, first select "Create a new wallet", then "I agree".<br>
            Choose and confirm a password that you'll use to access MetaMask, then click on the text "I understand that MetaMask...", and finally "Create a new wallet".<br>
            Select "Secure my wallet (recommended)", then "Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase".<br>
            Now you will see 12 words. Write them down on a piece of paper and keep in a safe place (offline!). By the way, you don't need to write down your public key, because from this "seed phrase" MetaMask can extrapolate both: private and public key.<br>
            After you've done it, click on "Next".<br>
            You'll be asked to verify your secret phrase.<br>
            Do it and click on "Confirm", then "Got it", "Next" and finally "Done".<br>
            You'll see now, at the top of the screen your first and last chars of your public address (something like: 0xowe...234l).<br>
            Go back to our page <a href="https://www.god-s-world.net">www.god-s-world.net</a>, refresh it and click on "Enter", then "Sign up with MetaMask".<br>
            A MetaMask window will appear, click on "Next", then "Connect".<br>
            Again a MetaMask window will pop up, with a Message: "www.god-s-world.net" and a random number. Click on "Sign".<br>
            After few seconds you'll see in the left bottom corner of the page the first and the last chars of your public key, exactly the same like in MetaMask window.<br>
            That means that from now on your progress will be saved.<br>
            Congratulations! You did it!<br>
            Have fun! :-)
        </div>
        <h3>How to install MetaMask on smartphone/tablet</h3>
        <div>
            Before or after reading this article you probably would like to watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvUFyZShd20">YouTube</a>.<br>
            Open "Google Play" on your Android device (or "Apple store" on IOS).<br>
            Search for "MetaMask" in the search field, then install the app and open it.<br>
            Click on "Get started".<br>
            This time click on "Import using Secret Recovery Phrase", becuase you want to use the same public key on your mobile device, right?<br>
            If by chance you haven't installed MetaMask on your computer and you want to install it only on your mobile device, select "Create a new wallet" instead (read "How to install MetaMask on computer" in that case, to proceed).<br>
            Now write the 12 words you've received signing up to MetaMask on computer.<br>
            Select "Confirm", then "Enable automatic security checks".<br>
            You'll be asked to take a tour, you can click on "No, Thanks".<br>
            Now you can see the same public address like you have on computer.<br>
            Click on "Browser" now.<br>
            In the address field type in our website address: <a href="https://www.god-s-world.net">www.god-s-world.net</a><br>
            A MetaMask window will appear, click on "Next", then "Connect".<br>
            Again a MetaMask window will pop up, with a Message: "www.god-s-world.net" and a random number. Click on "Sign".<br>
            After few seconds you'll see in the left bottom corner of the page the first and the last chars of your public key, exactly the same like in MetaMask window and like on your computer.<br>
            That means that from now on your progress will be saved, and you will use the same public address on your computer and mobile device.<br>
            Congratulations! You did it!<br><br>
            Keep in mind that from your smartphone/tablet you should enter our website only from the MetaMask application.<br>
            If you enter it from a "normal" browser, you'll not be able to use MetaMask in that case.
