        <h2>THE SCORING SYSTEM</h2>
        <div>
            In this project you can earn two types of points: GRACE and FAITH.<br><br>
            The points of GRACE you can achieve playing the games present on this website.<br>
            When you reach 100 points of GRACE, these will be transformed into 1 point of FAITH.<br><br>
            Every day you can earn no more than one point of FAITH.<br>
            Every day that you gain one point of FAITH, your FAITH increases by one, every day that you don't, your FAITH decreases by one.<br><br>
            At this moment there are only 2 games. These are points of GRACE that you can earn:<br><br>
            The first game: "GUESS THE WORDS".<br><br>
            - level "easy": 80<br>
            - level "medium": 90<br>
            - level "difficult": 100<br><br>
            The second game: "BLOCK THE BALL".<br><br>
            - level "easy": 5<br>
            - level "medium": 10<br>
            - level "difficult": 20<br><br>
            Some examples of how you can gain 100 points of GRACE (1 point of FAITH):<br><br>
            1) game 1, level "difficult" = 100<br>
            2) game 1, level "medium" + game 2, level "medium" = 90 + 10<br>
            3) game 1, level "easy" + game 2, level "difficult" = 80 + 20<br><br>
            A suggestion: it could be a good habit to discover the Today's Word (game 2) in the morning, then to read a chapter of the Bible during the day or in the evening (game 1).
        </div><br>
        <h4>CLARIFICATIONS</h4>
        <div>
            If by chance you'll earn more than 100 points of GRACE (for example playing game 1, level "medium" + game 2, level "difficult" = 110), it will be transformed anyway in exactly one point of FAITH. You can earn no more than one point of FAITH a day.<br><br>
            When you've earned one point of FAITH, the next points of GRACE you'll be able to earn only the next day, and only after at least 6 hours are passed after you've earned some GRACE points the day before.<br>
            For example: you've gained 1 point of FAITH two hours before the end of the day, then you play just one hour after the new day has started: in that case you'll earn no GRACE points, because there aren't passed 6 hours since you've earned one point of FAITH the day before.<br><br>
            If you've earned one point of FAITH and you continue to play, you will earn no more points that day, but your progress will be saved anyway (for example you can discover more Holy Bible chapters a day).<br><br>
            In the second game ("BLOCK THE BALL"), the number of words to discover is always limited to 10, so it will always take just few minutes to discover God's Word for today.<br><br>
            Keep in mind that in this project the new day very likely doesn't start at the same hour that in your country.<br><br>
